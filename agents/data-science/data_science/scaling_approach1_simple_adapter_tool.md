# Step-by-Step Rundown of the Adapter Pattern Approach

## What the New Root Agent Would Look Like

The new root agent would maintain essentially the same structure as your current implementation but with these key changes:

1. **New Tool Addition**: The root agent would have a new `data_source_adapter` tool alongside the existing `call_db_agent` and `call_ds_agent` tools.

2. **Enhanced State Initialization**: The `setup_before_agent_call` function would be expanded to initialize configuration for multiple data sources, not just BigQuery.

3. **Updated Instruction**: The root agent's instruction would be enhanced to explain that it can access multiple data sources and how to specify which data source to use.

Conceptually, your root agent declaration would look similar to this:

```python
root_agent = Agent(
    model=os.getenv("ROOT_AGENT_MODEL"),
    name="multi_db_ds_agent",
    instruction=return_instructions_root(),
    global_instruction=(
        f"""
        You are a Data Science and Data Analytics Multi Agent System that can access multiple data sources.

        """
    ),
    tools=[
        data_source_adapter,  # New adapter tool
        call_ds_agent,
        load_artifacts,
    ],
    before_agent_callback=setup_before_agent_call,
    generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.01),
)
```

## How the Data Source Adapter Tool Would Work

### Step 1: Tool Invocation

When a user asks a question involving a specific data source, the LLM powering the root agent recognizes this and calls the `data_source_adapter` tool, specifying:

- The question to answer
- The name of the data source to use (e.g., "bigquery", "mongodb")

### Step 2: Data Source Resolution

The adapter tool looks up the appropriate agent for the specified data source from its internal mapping:

```python
agent_map = {
    "bigquery": db_agent,
    "postgresql": pg_agent,
    "firestore": firestore_agent,
    "mongodb": mongo_agent,
}
```

### Step 3: Agent Tool Creation

The adapter creates an `AgentTool` instance wrapping the selected data source agent, which allows it to invoke that agent as a function.

### Step 4: Request Forwarding

The adapter forwards the user's question to the selected data source agent through the `AgentTool.run_async()` method, passing along the current tool context.

### Step 5: Result Storage

When the data source agent returns its result, the adapter stores it in the session state under a key specific to that data source (e.g., `"bigquery_result"`). This makes it available for potential further processing.

### Step 6: Result Return

The adapter returns the result back to the root agent, which can then determine if further processing is needed (e.g., calling the data science agent) or if it should be returned directly to the user.

## Complete Request Flow Example

1. **User Query**: "What was our total revenue by product category in Firestore last month?"

2. **Root Agent Processing**:
   - The root agent processes the query and identifies it needs data from Firestore
   - It decides to use the `data_source_adapter` tool

3. **Tool Invocation**:
   - The root agent calls `data_source_adapter` with:
     - question: "What was our total revenue by product category last month?"
     - source_name: "firestore"

4. **Adapter Processing**:
   - The adapter looks up the Firestore agent in its map
   - It wraps the Firestore agent in an `AgentTool`
   - It calls the Firestore agent with the question

5. **Firestore Agent Execution**:
   - The Firestore agent processes the request
   - It generates appropriate Firestore queries
   - It executes the queries against the Firestore database
   - It formats the results into a meaningful response
   - It returns the formatted data to the adapter

6. **Result Handling**:
   - The adapter stores the result in `tool_context.state["firestore_result"]`
   - It returns the result to the root agent

7. **Root Agent Decision**:
   - The root agent examines the result and decides if data science processing is needed
   - If yes: It calls `call_ds_agent` with the query result for further analysis
   - If no: It formats the result into a natural language response for the user

8. **Final Response**:
   - The root agent returns the final answer (either the direct database result or the processed data science result) to the user

This approach maintains the simplicity of your current design while adding the flexibility to work with multiple data sources through a clean abstraction layer. The root agent's behavior remains largely the same, but it now has the ability to route requests to the appropriate specialized data agent based on the user's needs.
